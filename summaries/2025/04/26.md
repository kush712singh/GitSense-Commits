# Activity Summary for 26/04/2025

## 15:52:51
The `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/adoption_pct.ts` file underwent extensive revision throughout the log.  Initially (14:59:16), it was a script using `require` syntax to fetch GitLab repositories, clone them, and count lines added since 2025-04-18 using `git log`.  It calculated a percentage of AI-generated code based on a predefined constant (`AI_ACCEPTED_LINES`).

Subsequent updates (14:59:30 - 15:02:05) involved switching to `import` syntax for modules and adding type definitions using interfaces, improving code clarity and type safety.  The error handling in several functions was improved to explicitly check for `Error` instances.

At 15:04:23, a new function `calculateAdoptionPct` was added, seemingly unrelated to the GitLab analysis. This function calculates a simple adoption percentage based on active and total users.  This was later extracted to its own separate file (15:06:10 - 15:06:44).

A significant change occurred at 15:12:07. The `getModifiedLines` function was modified to accept only the repository name instead of the full path, removing the need for the `cloneRepository` function at this point. The date range for the git log command was changed.

Further revisions (15:12:17 - 15:17:04) focused on refining the repository fetching process by adding parameters to the GitLab API request to filter repositories by last activity date (originally 2024-04-18 and 2024-04-19 then updated to only 2024-04-18), improving efficiency and relevance.  The date range in `getModifiedLines` is similarly restricted.

Around 15:38:20, the script's purpose shifted. The AI-related calculations were removed, and the focus changed to simply displaying the total number of modified lines in each repository and the overall total.

At 15:43:25,  the `cloneRepository` function was reintroduced, causing the script to clone repositories before counting modified lines.

The final versions (15:45:44 onwards) introduce significant improvements to error handling and robustness.  The `cloneRepository` function is enhanced to handle both cloning and pulling, with more detailed error messages and logging (`--quiet` and `--no-edit` flags added to git commands).  The `getRepositories` function was also improved to handle pagination to retrieve all repositories from GitLab, rather than just a single page, greatly increasing scalability.

The `/Users/kushalsingh/git/tsconfig.json` file was updated twice (15:03:59 and 15:04:06) with no discernible changes in content, suggesting a possible redundant commit.  The `tsconfig.json` file consistently targets ES2020, uses commonjs modules, and enables strict type checking.

In summary, the main evolution of `adoption_pct.ts` involved a shift from analyzing AI code contribution to counting total modified lines in GitLab repositories within a specific time window, with significant improvements in error handling, robustness, and code structure along the way.  The adoption percentage calculation was separated into a different file.
