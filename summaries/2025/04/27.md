# Activity Summary for 27/04/2025

## 13:28:52
The `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/adoption_pct.ts` file was updated on 27/04/2025 at 12:35:07.  This TypeScript script retrieves a list of GitLab repositories that have been active since April 24th, 2025.  It uses the GitLab API and a provided token (`GITLAB_TOKEN`) to fetch repository information, filtering for repositories under the `urbanclap/` namespace.

The script then iterates through each repository, cloning it if it doesn't exist locally or pulling the latest changes if it does.  The cloning/pulling process is handled using `child_process.exec` to execute git commands.  Crucially, it calculates the number of lines inserted in each repository since April 24th, 2025, using `git log` and `awk`.  Finally, it prints a summary showing the number of lines added in each repository and the total across all repositories.  The script includes robust error handling, using promises to manage asynchronous operations.  The cutoff date for repository activity and the date range for counting modified lines is consistently set to April 24th, 2025.
