# Activity Summary for 24/04/2025

## 01:24:33
The `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/adoption_pct.ts` file was updated on 24/04/2025 at 00:34:53.  This file contains a Node.js script designed to calculate the percentage of code modifications in GitLab repositories that might be attributed to AI, based on a predefined threshold (`AI_ACCEPTED_LINES`).

The script performs the following actions:

1. **Fetches repositories:** It uses the `axios` library to retrieve a list of GitLab repositories using a provided GitLab token and URL (these are hardcoded, and redacted here for security).

2. **Clones/updates repositories:** For each repository, it clones the repository using `git clone` if it doesn't exist locally, or pulls the latest changes using `git pull` if it already exists.  The script uses `child_process.exec` to interact with the Git command line.

3. **Calculates modified lines:** It uses `git log` to count lines added in the past year.  It uses `awk` to sum the insertion counts.

4. **Calculates AI percentage:** Finally, it calculates the percentage of AI-generated code by dividing the `AI_ACCEPTED_LINES` constant by the total number of modified lines across all repositories.

The script includes robust error handling using `try...catch` blocks for various operations like fetching repositories, cloning/pulling, and getting modified lines.  The primary function is `main()`, which orchestrates the entire process.  The script outputs the total number of repositories processed, total modified lines, the AI accepted lines threshold, and the calculated AI code percentage.  The script's logic relies heavily on external commands (Git and `awk`) executed via `child_process.exec`.
