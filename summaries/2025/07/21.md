# Activity Summary for 21/07/2025

## 11:50:55
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/cortex_streamlit_app/streamlit_app.py` and `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/cortex_streamlit_app/TEAM_ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md`.  The `streamlit_app.py` file underwent significant changes related to data visualization within a Streamlit application.  Initially, the code provided basic functionality for creating bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and histograms.  Subsequent commits introduced "smart" aggregation logic, automatically choosing between `sum` and `mean` based on whether the y-axis column represents a percentage or a count/amount. Further updates added features similar to Redash, allowing users to select multiple y-axes for comparison and enabling grouping of data using a categorical column.  These changes also enhanced chart formatting, adding percentage symbols where appropriate, and dynamically adjusting y-axis ranges based on data values.  The updates were made between 11:21:30 and 11:50:31 on July 21, 2025.

The `TEAM_ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md` file received several minor edits between 11:33:24 and 11:35:19 on July 21, 2025. These modifications seem to primarily involve minor stylistic changes and additions to the guide's content, but no structural or content changes of great significance are evident. The changes are predominantly related to refinements in wording and formatting within the document.


## 12:52:53
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/cortex_streamlit_app/streamlit_app.py` file between 11:55:12 and 12:08:58 on July 21, 2025.  No substantive changes were made to the code during these revisions; all edits appear to be insignificant and likely related to version control or minor formatting adjustments.  The code itself defines a Streamlit application that interacts with a Snowflake database via an API endpoint (`/api/v2/cortex/analyst/message`).  The application allows users to execute SQL queries, filter the resulting DataFrames, and create various visualizations (bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, histograms) using Plotly.  The code includes smart aggregation logic to handle different data types (percentages, counts, amounts) appropriately for visualization.  The `SEMANTIC_MODELS` dictionary suggests support for different data sources or views within Snowflake ("payments" and "finance").


## 19:01:48
The log shows a series of edits to the `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/cortex_streamlit_app/streamlit_app.py` file between 16:30:30 and 18:33:24 on July 21, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on enhancing the data visualization capabilities of a Streamlit application that interacts with a Snowflake database and a Text-to-SQL API.

Initially, the code includes functions for establishing a Snowflake connection, querying the database, handling API requests to the Urban Company Text-to-SQL API (`/api/v2/cortex/analyst/message`),  filtering dataframes using Streamlit widgets (multiselect and slider), and creating visualizations using Plotly Express.  The application supports bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and histograms.  A key feature is the "smart aggregation" which intelligently handles different data types (percentage, count, amount columns) when creating charts, using averages or sums as appropriate.

Subsequent commits introduce improvements:

* **Improved date handling:** A `smart_sort_dataframe` function is added to handle date sorting more robustly.  It attempts to convert date strings to datetime objects, trying multiple formats (`%d-%m-%Y`, `%m-%d-%Y`) before falling back to string sorting if the conversion is unsuccessful (less than 50% successful). This enhances the chronological ordering of date columns in the visualizations.

* **Documentation enhancements:**  The docstrings are consistently updated to improve clarity and readability.  The info section within the app, using `st.expander`, is expanded to highlight additional features and improvements ("Redash-like features" such as multi-select Y-axis, smart grouping, faceted views, and inline workflow).

* **Minor bug fixes:** A minor bug related to the sorting of dataframes in bar chart visualizations is fixed. The dataframe is now explicitly sorted before plotting in the `create_visualizations` function.

The `setup_sis_deployment.sql` file contains a script for deploying the Streamlit application to Snowflake. This script creates the necessary database objects (database, schema, roles, warehouse) and grants the appropriate permissions to users and roles, using  `GRANT` statements extensively. It also includes instructions for creating and deploying the Streamlit app through the Snowsight UI and verification queries to confirm successful setup.  The script details setting up a resource monitor (`CORTEX_ANALYST_MONITOR`) to control resource usage and costs.  The overall changes show a focus on making the application more user-friendly, robust and efficiently managed within a Snowflake environment.
