# Activity Summary for 21/07/2025

## 11:50:55
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/cortex_streamlit_app/streamlit_app.py` and `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/cortex_streamlit_app/TEAM_ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md`.  The `streamlit_app.py` file underwent significant changes related to data visualization within a Streamlit application.  Initially, the code provided basic functionality for creating bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and histograms.  Subsequent commits introduced "smart" aggregation logic, automatically choosing between `sum` and `mean` based on whether the y-axis column represents a percentage or a count/amount. Further updates added features similar to Redash, allowing users to select multiple y-axes for comparison and enabling grouping of data using a categorical column.  These changes also enhanced chart formatting, adding percentage symbols where appropriate, and dynamically adjusting y-axis ranges based on data values.  The updates were made between 11:21:30 and 11:50:31 on July 21, 2025.

The `TEAM_ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md` file received several minor edits between 11:33:24 and 11:35:19 on July 21, 2025. These modifications seem to primarily involve minor stylistic changes and additions to the guide's content, but no structural or content changes of great significance are evident. The changes are predominantly related to refinements in wording and formatting within the document.


## 12:52:53
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/cortex_streamlit_app/streamlit_app.py` file between 11:55:12 and 12:08:58 on July 21, 2025.  No substantive changes were made to the code during these revisions; all edits appear to be insignificant and likely related to version control or minor formatting adjustments.  The code itself defines a Streamlit application that interacts with a Snowflake database via an API endpoint (`/api/v2/cortex/analyst/message`).  The application allows users to execute SQL queries, filter the resulting DataFrames, and create various visualizations (bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, histograms) using Plotly.  The code includes smart aggregation logic to handle different data types (percentages, counts, amounts) appropriately for visualization.  The `SEMANTIC_MODELS` dictionary suggests support for different data sources or views within Snowflake ("payments" and "finance").
