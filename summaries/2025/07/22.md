# Activity Summary for 22/07/2025

## 08:07:44
The log shows a series of edits to the `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/cortex_streamlit_app/streamlit_app.py` file between July 21st, 2025, 19:07 and July 22nd, 2025, 07:20.  The code appears to be a Streamlit application interacting with a Snowflake database and an Urban Company API.  Notably, there are many consecutive edits with identical code, suggesting either repeated saving without changes or a version control issue.  The changes made between July 21st, 19:07 and July 21st, 19:42 are negligible; they do not alter the code's functionality.

A significant change occurs on July 22nd, 2025, at 07:20 with the creation of a backup file, `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/cortex_streamlit_app/streamlit_app_backup.py`, containing a version of the Streamlit app.

Further modifications occurred to `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/cortex_streamlit_app/semantic_models/PAYMENTS_CONVERSION_ANALYSIS.yaml` between July 22nd, 07:23 and 07:31. These changes primarily involve the addition of a `PAYMENTGATEWAYTRANSACTIONID` dimension to the `ONLINEPAYMENTTRANSACTIONS_DP` table. This dimension is described as a unique identifier for transactions, and  synonyms provided suggest it could represent different naming conventions used by various payment gateways. The `sample_values` section remains consistently empty throughout these modifications, which indicates there was no effort to populated sample values for this dimension.  The other parts of the `PAYMENTS_CONVERSION_ANALYSIS.yaml` file remain unchanged across these edits.
