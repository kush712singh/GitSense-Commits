# Activity Summary for 22/07/2025

## 08:07:44
The log shows a series of edits to the `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/cortex_streamlit_app/streamlit_app.py` file between July 21st, 2025, 19:07 and July 22nd, 2025, 07:20.  The code appears to be a Streamlit application interacting with a Snowflake database and an Urban Company API.  Notably, there are many consecutive edits with identical code, suggesting either repeated saving without changes or a version control issue.  The changes made between July 21st, 19:07 and July 21st, 19:42 are negligible; they do not alter the code's functionality.

A significant change occurs on July 22nd, 2025, at 07:20 with the creation of a backup file, `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/cortex_streamlit_app/streamlit_app_backup.py`, containing a version of the Streamlit app.

Further modifications occurred to `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/cortex_streamlit_app/semantic_models/PAYMENTS_CONVERSION_ANALYSIS.yaml` between July 22nd, 07:23 and 07:31. These changes primarily involve the addition of a `PAYMENTGATEWAYTRANSACTIONID` dimension to the `ONLINEPAYMENTTRANSACTIONS_DP` table. This dimension is described as a unique identifier for transactions, and  synonyms provided suggest it could represent different naming conventions used by various payment gateways. The `sample_values` section remains consistently empty throughout these modifications, which indicates there was no effort to populated sample values for this dimension.  The other parts of the `PAYMENTS_CONVERSION_ANALYSIS.yaml` file remain unchanged across these edits.


## 14:34:28
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/cortex_streamlit_app/semantic_models/PAYMENTS_CONVERSION_ANALYSIS.yaml` file,  a YAML file defining a semantic view for payments conversion analysis.  The key changes across revisions are:


* **10:21:09 - 10:26:20:**  These revisions show no changes in the YAML content itself.  The file is repeatedly saved, likely due to minor edits or autosaves within the editor.

* **10:35:51:** A significant update expands the `sample_values` list within the `PAYMENTGATEWAYCODE` dimension.  Initially, only "RAZORPAY" and "CRED" were listed. This revision adds several more payment gateways, including "PAYTM", "PHONEPE", "GPAY", "AMAZONPAY", "MOBIKWIK", "FREECHARGE", "PAYPAL", and "STRIPE".


* **10:40:09:** Further refinement of the `PAYMENTGATEWAYCODE` dimension's description, clarifying that gateway names are stored in uppercase and providing additional synonyms.

* **10:42:51:** The `CURRENCY` dimension is updated to include synonyms for "country," reflecting that the currency is used to identify country-specific success rates.


* **11:04:46 - 11:09:57:**  Minor edits and clarifications to comments within the `PAYMENTGATEWAYCODE` dimension description. These edits further clarify the usage of the gateway codes and suggest a preferential matching strategy.


* **11:24:43:** A critical global instruction is added at the beginning of the YAML file. This instruction mandates a hybrid matching logic for all dimensions with `sample_values`.  The rule specifies that if a user query matches a sample value exactly, that sample value should be used; otherwise, use the exact user query. This addresses potential discrepancies between user inputs and the values stored in the database.

* **11:29:03:** The crucial global instruction about hybrid matching (introduced at 11:24:43) is slightly reformatted but retains the same core meaning.


* **12:10:53:**  The `DEVICE_OS` dimension gains a more detailed description, explicitly stating the important matching rule for user queries versus `sample_values`, providing examples (e.g., "web" maps to "web," but "desktop_web" stays "desktop_web").


In summary, the main development pattern is a progressive refinement of the semantic model, specifically focusing on more robust handling of user inputs and a more comprehensive list of payment gateways. The inclusion of the crucial global instruction at 11:24:43 represents a critical step in ensuring data consistency and accuracy within the application.
