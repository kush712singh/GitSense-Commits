# Activity Summary for 26/07/2025

## 00:06:13
The codebase undergoes several revisions between 23:39 and 23:46 on July 25th, 2025, primarily focusing on the `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/xl_chatbot_app/components/ai_engine.py` file.  These changes introduce functionalities for handling query instructions and improving the robustness of  table name handling.

Initially, the `ai_engine.py` file is structured around AI provider integration (OpenAI and Anthropic), use-case based LLM execution (`executeLLM`), and prompt building functions.  A significant change is the addition of query instructions functionality around 23:40. This involves loading instructions from `query_instructions.yaml`, detecting data patterns based on column names, determining applicable instructions, and building instruction text.  Further refinements occur between 23:40 and 23:46, enhancing the `build_instructions_text` function to dynamically replace placeholders in instructions with data extracted from a provided semantic model.  This dynamic replacement leverages the `extract_dynamic_data_from_semantic_model` and `replace_dynamic_placeholders` functions. The `extract_dynamic_data_from_semantic_model` function extracts relevant data such as filter columns, date columns and example values from the semantic model.

The `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/xl_chatbot_app/main_app.py` file is modified at 23:57 and subsequently at 00:01 on July 26th, 2025. These changes primarily enhance the data loading and table name handling within the Streamlit application.  The `clean_table_name` function is improved to create valid SQL table names, considering alphanumeric characters and length limitations.  The `load_dataframe_to_duckdb` function is updated to use quoted identifiers for safe handling of special characters in table names and includes more robust error handling and success messages.
