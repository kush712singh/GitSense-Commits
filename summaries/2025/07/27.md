The log shows changes to `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/xl_chatbot_app/config/prompt_constants.py` on 27/07/2025 at 01:35:15.  The file contains Python code defining several AI prompts in a "TCREI" (Typed Customer Request Evaluation Interface) format.  These prompts are structured dictionaries, each with fields like `promptName`, `task`, `context`, `role`, `instructions`, `inputData`, `outputSchema`, and `modelConfig`.

The main changes revolve around the creation or modification of three prompts:

* **`COLUMN_CLASSIFICATION`**: This prompt is designed for classifying dataset columns into semantic types (dimension, metric, fact, time_dimension).  It provides detailed instructions to the AI on how to analyze column metadata (data type, sample values) and classify each column, including providing a description, aliases, and a justification for its classification.  The output is expected to be a JSON array.

* **`COLUMN_CLASSIFICATION_BACKUP`**:  This appears to be a backup or alternative version of `COLUMN_CLASSIFICATION`. The key difference lies in instruction point 4, which outlines different classification rules based on cardinality ratio.  While `COLUMN_CLASSIFICATION` prioritizes date/time patterns in column names or values for 'time_dimension', this backup uses cardinality and aggregation potential as primary classification criteria.  Otherwise, both prompts have similar structure and expected output.

* **`TEXT_TO_SQL`**: This prompt focuses on converting natural language questions into SQL queries.  It emphasizes using a provided semantic model, adhering to specific formatting and business rules (e.g., using `ILIKE` for case-insensitive text filters, handling long text columns with wildcards, defaulting time periods to the past 30 days if unspecified, and handling potential division by zero errors). The prompt instructs the AI to first explain its interpretation of the natural language query before generating the SQL.

All three prompts utilize the `openai` provider and `gpt-4o` model with similar parameters. The consistent structure and use of JSON for output schema suggests a standardized approach to prompt design and AI response handling within the application.
