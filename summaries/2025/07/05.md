# Activity Summary for 05/07/2025

## 21:44:36
The log shows numerous updates to the `/Users/kushalsingh/git/crm/package.json` file between 20:52:02 and 21:18:55 on May 7, 2025.  The content of `package.json` remained consistent throughout these changes; it describes a Node.js/TypeScript backend for a real estate CRM system, listing its dependencies and devDependencies, scripts for development, building, testing and linting.  There is no apparent change in the content of the file across all commits.  The frequent timestamps suggest repeated saving or committing of the `package.json` file, possibly due to an iterative development process.

A separate `jest.config.js` file was modified at 21:19:04 on May 7, 2025.  This file configures the Jest testing framework, specifying settings for test environment, root directories, file matching patterns, transformations, code coverage, reporting, and setup files.  The  `jest.config.js` file describes the testing configuration for the project.


## 23:02:07
The log shows multiple code changes across several files within a CRM application.  The most significant changes involve the `/Users/kushalsingh/git/crm/src/interfaces/api.ts` file, which undergoes numerous revisions between 22:08:39 and 22:12:05.  These revisions primarily involve adding new API routes for managing agencies and users, expanding functionality beyond the initial lead and task management.  The additions include comprehensive CRUD operations for agencies and users, with appropriate role-based access control using `requireRole` and `requireAgencyAccess` middleware.  The `/dashboard/stats` endpoint is also modified to utilize the `taskController` method directly instead of a separate `async` function, likely as part of a refactoring effort to improve code organization.

The `/Users/kushalsingh/git/crm/src/application/leads/lead.service.ts` file is updated at 22:05:11 and again at 22:05:48.  However, a comparison of the two commits shows no actual change in code content.  This suggests that the second commit might have been a redundant or erroneous commit.

The `/Users/kushalsingh/git/crm/src/application/leads/lead.controller.ts` file shows no meaningful changes between the two timestamps in the log.  Similarly, the `/Users/kushalsingh/git/crm/src/server.ts` file undergoes several updates, but those updates only involve minor timestamp changes without altering the core functionality of the server code, suggesting possible repeated commits of the same code.

In summary, the major development effort focused on expanding the API with user and agency management features.  The lead and task modules remain largely unchanged, apart from potential redundant commits.  The use of Zod for input validation is consistent throughout the lead-related code. The consistent use of `try...catch` blocks and detailed error handling is notable in all controller functions.  There is also consistent use of middleware for authentication and authorization.
