# Activity Summary for 19/07/2025

## 18:50:40
The log shows a series of modifications to `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/cortex_streamlit_app/streamlit_app.py`.  The initial version (18:33:23) was a Streamlit application interacting with Snowflake and a Cortex API to answer natural language questions.  It used a  Snowflake session to execute SQL queries and made API calls to `/api/v2/cortex/agent:run`. The response processing involved handling Server-Sent Events (SSE).

Subsequent updates (starting 18:34:35) significantly refactored the application. The key changes include:

* **API Endpoint Change:** The API endpoint was changed from `/api/v2/cortex/agent:run` to `/api/v2/cortex/analyst/message`, indicating a switch to a different Cortex service (likely the Cortex Analyst API).
* **Semantic Model Management:** The code moved to a dictionary `SEMANTIC_MODELS` to manage semantic model paths for different agent types ("payments" and "finance").  This allows for selecting different models depending on the user's need.  Placeholder paths (`@YOUR_DATABASE.YOUR_SCHEMA.YOUR_STAGE/...`) were initially used and later  commented out, replaced with example paths.
* **Improved Error Handling:** More robust error handling was added to the API calls, providing more informative error messages including response codes and request IDs.
* **Data Handling & Visualization:** Substantial additions focused on handling Pandas DataFrames, adding interactive filtering and sorting controls within a Streamlit app.  This included using `plotly.express` for creating various chart types (bar, line, scatter, histogram) based on user selection.
* **Streamlit App Enhancements:** The Streamlit app structure was enhanced with tabs ("Chat Interface", "SQL Query", "Results & Analytics") to better organize the functionality and improve user experience.  Session state management was introduced to persist the chat history.

The changes from 18:35:16 to 18:37:56 are largely incremental improvements and refinements to the DataFrame filtering, visualization, and session state handling, rather than major architectural shifts.  The final version (18:37:56)  is a complete and much more sophisticated Streamlit application that allows users to interact with a natural language interface, receive SQL queries, view results as DataFrames, and generate interactive visualizations. The evolution of the code shows a clear progression from a basic question-answering app to a feature-rich data analysis tool.
