# Activity Summary for 19/07/2025

## 18:50:40
The log shows a series of modifications to `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/cortex_streamlit_app/streamlit_app.py`.  The initial version (18:33:23) was a Streamlit application interacting with Snowflake and a Cortex API to answer natural language questions.  It used a  Snowflake session to execute SQL queries and made API calls to `/api/v2/cortex/agent:run`. The response processing involved handling Server-Sent Events (SSE).

Subsequent updates (starting 18:34:35) significantly refactored the application. The key changes include:

* **API Endpoint Change:** The API endpoint was changed from `/api/v2/cortex/agent:run` to `/api/v2/cortex/analyst/message`, indicating a switch to a different Cortex service (likely the Cortex Analyst API).
* **Semantic Model Management:** The code moved to a dictionary `SEMANTIC_MODELS` to manage semantic model paths for different agent types ("payments" and "finance").  This allows for selecting different models depending on the user's need.  Placeholder paths (`@YOUR_DATABASE.YOUR_SCHEMA.YOUR_STAGE/...`) were initially used and later  commented out, replaced with example paths.
* **Improved Error Handling:** More robust error handling was added to the API calls, providing more informative error messages including response codes and request IDs.
* **Data Handling & Visualization:** Substantial additions focused on handling Pandas DataFrames, adding interactive filtering and sorting controls within a Streamlit app.  This included using `plotly.express` for creating various chart types (bar, line, scatter, histogram) based on user selection.
* **Streamlit App Enhancements:** The Streamlit app structure was enhanced with tabs ("Chat Interface", "SQL Query", "Results & Analytics") to better organize the functionality and improve user experience.  Session state management was introduced to persist the chat history.

The changes from 18:35:16 to 18:37:56 are largely incremental improvements and refinements to the DataFrame filtering, visualization, and session state handling, rather than major architectural shifts.  The final version (18:37:56)  is a complete and much more sophisticated Streamlit application that allows users to interact with a natural language interface, receive SQL queries, view results as DataFrames, and generate interactive visualizations. The evolution of the code shows a clear progression from a basic question-answering app to a feature-rich data analysis tool.


## 20:51:05
The log shows a Streamlit application undergoing development between 19:09 and 19:44 on July 19, 2025.  The primary file modified is `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/cortex_streamlit_app/streamlit_app.py`.  Changes focus on refining the user interface and integrating with a Snowflake environment.

**`/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/cortex_streamlit_app/streamlit_app.py` Updates:**

Early changes (19:09:54 - 19:11:06) involved adding a new agent type ("payments_conversion") to the `SEMANTIC_MODELS` dictionary,  indicating the addition of a new payments conversion analysis capability.  The file also contains functions for:

*   Establishing a Snowflake connection using `snowflake.snowpark`.
*   Sending requests to a Cortex Analyst API (`/api/v2/cortex/analyst/message`) using a custom `_snowflake` module.  This module is not shown in the log but is clearly an important component.
*   Executing SQL queries against the Snowflake database and converting results to Pandas DataFrames.
*   Providing Streamlit widgets for interactive data filtering (multiselect, slider) and sorting.
*   Generating interactive visualizations (bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, histograms) using Plotly.
*   Managing Streamlit session state for chat history, SQL queries, and query results.

Later updates (19:21:32 onwards) reflect a shift towards using the actual Snowflake environment, replacing placeholder database paths with  `@UC_DATA_PROD.PUBLIC.SEMANTIC_MODELS/payments_conversion_analysis.yaml` and `@UC_DATA_PROD.PUBLIC.SEMANTIC_MODELS/finance_analytics.yaml`. A welcome message was also added for first-time users.  Minor UI improvements, such as agent-specific descriptions in the sidebar, were also included in the later commits.


**`/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/cortex_streamlit_app/semantic_models/PAYMENTS_CONVERSION_ANALYSIS.yaml` Updates:**

This file, a YAML configuration for a Snowflake semantic model, underwent multiple revisions (19:13:08, 19:14:38, 19:14:50, 19:14:58, 19:15:08, 19:23:58, 19:25:22) between 19:13 and 19:25. These changes do not appear to be substantial, though likely involving minor corrections or additions to the metadata, synonyms, or sample values within the definition. The file defines the structure and metadata of a semantic view, `PAYMENTS_CONVERSION_ANALYSIS`, connecting to multiple tables in the `UC_DATA_PROD` database to analyze payment initiations and success rates.  It appears to be a well-structured and detailed schema definition.


**Overall Pattern:**

The overall pattern reveals an iterative development process, starting with a prototype, progressively refining the application to interact with a real Snowflake database and integrating with the Cortex Analyst API.  The development process focused on both functionality (connecting to Snowflake, API interaction) and usability (Streamlit UI enhancements).


## 21:50:36
The log shows development of a Streamlit application connecting to Snowflake Cortex Analyst for natural language SQL conversion.  The `README.md` file (21:27:05) details the app's features, prerequisites (Snowflake account, Cortex Analyst, specific roles and access), setup instructions (including Snowflake package installation and semantic model upload), project structure, configuration (semantic models and database), and usage guidelines (agent selection, sample queries, SQL review, result analysis, and chat management).  It highlights support for multiple semantic models ("payments," "finance"), interactive data visualizations (bar, line, scatter, histogram charts), and data filtering and sorting capabilities.

The `streamlit_app.py` file undergoes several modifications between 21:28:43 and 21:29:25. These changes primarily focus on refining the application's configuration, specifically the `SEMANTIC_MODELS` dictionary. The path to the "payments" semantic model is updated to point to  `"@UC_DATA_PROD.PUBLIC.SEMANTIC_MODELS/PAYMENTS_CONVERSION_ANALYSIS.yaml"`. The path for the "finance" model remains a placeholder.  The core functionality of the application, including API interaction (`get_analyst_response`), SQL execution (`execute_sql_query`), data filtering (`filter_dataframe`), visualization (`create_visualizations`), and result display (`display_dataframe_with_controls`), remains consistent across these commits, suggesting iterative refinements rather than major structural changes.  The minor timestamp differences suggest quick iterations and bug fixes or minor improvements to the application's configuration and possibly error handling within the `get_analyst_response` function.  There is no significant change in functionality observed in the commits for `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/cortex_streamlit_app/streamlit_app.py` file.
