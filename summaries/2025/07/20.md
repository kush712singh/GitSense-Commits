# Activity Summary for 20/07/2025

## 00:50:36
The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/cortex_streamlit_app/streamlit_app.py` file.  The key changes revolve around improving the Streamlit application's user interface and functionality.

The initial commit (20/07/2025, 00:09:22) establishes a Streamlit application named "Cortex Analyst - Natural Language to SQL," connecting to a Snowflake database via an API.  The application includes functions for sending natural language queries to the API, executing SQL queries received from the API, displaying results as DataFrames, and creating interactive visualizations using Plotly.

Subsequent commits (20/07/2025, 00:42:24, 00:42:45, 00:43:16, 00:43:38) rename the application to "Urban Company Text to SQL" and refine the application's UI/UX.  The API error messages are updated to reflect the new application name.  The most significant changes include:

* **00:42:45:** Addition of dynamic y-axis range adjustments in visualizations to improve readability.  The y-axis range now adapts to the data's minimum and maximum values with padding.
* **00:43:16:**  Removal of explicit sorting buttons.  The application now allows sorting by clicking directly on DataFrame column headers.
* **00:43:38:** The display of row count and a sorting tip is improved for better user experience.


Throughout the commits, the core functionality (Snowflake connection, API interaction, data processing, and visualization) remains consistent.  The changes primarily focus on enhancing the clarity and usability of the application.  The `SEMANTIC_MODELS` dictionary remains unchanged, indicating that the available data sources ("payments" and "finance") are not altered.


## 09:30:33
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/cortex_streamlit_app/streamlit_app.py`.  The file is a Streamlit application that interacts with a Snowflake database via an API to provide a text-to-SQL interface.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout the revisions, but several changes are evident:

* **Initial Commit (01:00:25):** The initial commit establishes the basic structure of the application.  This includes importing necessary libraries (Streamlit, Pandas, Plotly, Snowflake connector), defining API endpoints and timeouts, and creating functions for:
    * Retrieving a Snowflake session.
    * Sending requests to the Urban Company Text-to-SQL API (`get_analyst_response`).
    * Executing SQL queries (`execute_sql_query`).
    * Filtering and displaying DataFrames (`filter_dataframe`, `display_dataframe_with_controls`).
    * Creating interactive visualizations (`create_visualizations`).
    * Managing Streamlit session state (`initialize_session_state`).
    * The main application logic (`main`).
    The application supports two "agents" ("payments" and "finance"), each linked to a different Snowflake semantic view.

* **Minor Revisions (01:00:38, 01:02:34, 01:04:07):** These commits show no substantive code changes; they appear to be incremental saves without functional alterations.

* **Typo Correction (01:09:57):**  A minor typo in `y__padding` was corrected to `y_padding` within the `create_visualizations` function.

* **Sidebar Enhancement (01:10:14, 01:10:33):** The application's sidebar was improved.  The agent selection was enhanced to automatically update the session state and trigger a page refresh (`st.rerun`) when the user changes the selected agent.  Additional information about the selected agent and its associated semantic view was also added.

* **Agent Description Added (01:20:44, 01:34:57):**  The final commit adds agent-specific descriptions to the sidebar.  For the "payments" agent, a description detailing the analysis focus (payment conversion, success rates, etc.) was introduced.  The "finance" agent description is incomplete ("placeholder").  These changes improve the user experience by providing context-specific information.

Throughout the entire process, the core functions and structure of the application remained largely unchanged.  The changes primarily focused on improving the user interface and user experience, adding descriptive information, and fixing a minor coding error.  The consistent use of `st.cache_resource` for the Snowflake session suggests a focus on efficiency and avoiding repeated database connections.


## 14:57:39
The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/cortex_streamlit_app/streamlit_app.py` file and the `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/cortex_streamlit_app/semantic_models/PAYMENTS_CONVERSION_ANALYSIS.yaml` file.  The `streamlit_app.py` file remained largely unchanged throughout the updates, indicating minor adjustments or no changes to the application logic itself between 09:33:07 and 09:45:33.


The  `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/cortex_streamlit_app/semantic_models/PAYMENTS_CONVERSION_ANALYSIS.yaml` file, however, underwent significant changes between 09:54:42 and 14:48:32. These changes primarily focused on enhancing the  `custom_instructions` section.


Specifically, the modifications introduced:


* **Standardized Time Periods:**  The YAML file now includes explicit definitions for handling various time period inputs ("Past 3 months," "Past 90 days," etc.), standardizing them to consistent date calculations using `DATEADD` function in Snowflake.  A default of 90 days was added for queries without a specified time range.

* **Standardized Aggregation Windows:** Similar to time periods, defaults for aggregation windows (daily, weekly, monthly) were introduced. The default aggregation was set to daily, unless otherwise specified in the query.

* **Country to Currency Mapping:** A new section was added to map country names (India, Singapore, UAE, Saudi Arabia) to their respective currency codes for simplified filtering.

The updates to the `custom_instructions` aim to create more consistent and predictable query results by imposing strict rules on how time periods, aggregation, and filtering are handled within the semantic model.  The overall goal appears to improve the user experience by simplifying query generation and making the results more reliable.


## 16:57:31
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/cortex_streamlit_app/streamlit_app.py` between 16:53:16 and 16:54:57 on 20/07/2025.  There are no discernible code changes across these commits; the code remains identical in each version.  A separate file, `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/cortex_streamlit_app/semantic_models/PAYMENTS_CONVERSION_ANALYSIS.yaml`, was updated at 16:53:49. This file is a YAML configuration file defining a semantic model named `PAYMENTS_CONVERSION_ANALYSIS`.  It details data sources, column descriptions, formatting standards, and best practices for querying this specific semantic view within a Snowflake database.  The description includes information about data structures, required formatting for date and time, aggregation windows, and handling of potential issues like division by zero.  The file also specifies conventions for naming columns, filtering data (e.g., excluding test transactions), and mapping countries to their respective currencies.  The `tables` section lists tables used in the semantic view, along with their column names, synonyms, descriptions, expressions, data types, and sample values.


## 17:58:44
The log shows multiple revisions to a Streamlit application (`streamlit_app.py`) and a semantic model definition file (`PAYMENTS_CONVERSION_ANALYSIS.yaml`).  The `streamlit_app.py` file remained largely unchanged across multiple commits between 17:14:06 and 17:33:53, suggesting minor or no functional changes during that period. A later change at 17:32:33 and 17:33:09 also shows no significant code alterations.

The `PAYMENTS_CONVERSION_ANALYSIS.yaml` file underwent several revisions between 17:45:38 and 17:47:06. These changes focused primarily on clarifying instructions for country-based queries. Initially, the instructions were detailed and included many best practices, but later revisions simplified the "Country Analysis Instructions" section to a concise, critical instruction:  always use the CURRENCY field for country identification,  providing specific mappings for India, Singapore, UAE, and Saudi Arabia.  The overall change reflects a shift toward a more direct and less verbose approach to specifying country analysis rules.  The later additions of `verified_queries` in `PAYMENTS_CONVERSION_ANALYSIS_CLEAN.yaml` at 17:53:05 show example queries and their corresponding SQL, which were not present in earlier versions.  Finally,  a change at 17:55:59 to `PAYMENTS_CONVERSION_ANALYSIS.yaml` added `time_dimensions` to the YAML structure, suggesting an enhancement to handle time-based data more explicitly.  The `COUNTRY_MAPPING_DIRECT_FIX.md` file had only an empty commit, suggesting a potential placeholder or a file that was inadvertently included in the log.


## 18:57:32
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/cortex_streamlit_app/streamlit_app.py` file between 18:41:34 and 18:50:45 on July 20, 2025.  The changes appear to be minor and do not affect the overall functionality of the code.  The code is a Streamlit application that interacts with a Snowflake database using a custom API (`/api/v2/cortex/analyst/message`).

The application allows users to select between "payments" and "finance" agents, each associated with a specific Snowflake semantic view (`UC_DATA_PROD.PUBLIC.PAYMENTS_CONVERSION_ANALYSIS` and `UC_DATA_PROD.PUBLIC.TEST`, respectively).  The code extensively uses Pandas for data manipulation, Plotly for visualization, and includes functions for:

*   Retrieving analyst responses from the API (`get_analyst_response`).
*   Executing SQL queries on Snowflake (`execute_sql_query`).
*   Filtering and displaying DataFrames with interactive controls (`filter_dataframe`, `display_dataframe_with_controls`).
*   Creating various chart types (bar, line, scatter, histogram) based on user selections (`create_visualizations`).
*   Managing Streamlit session state to maintain chat history, current SQL query, and query results (`initialize_session_state`).

No significant functional changes are observed across the multiple commits. The timestamps suggest a period of rapid, minor edits or corrections within a short timeframe.


## 20:41:15
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/cortex_streamlit_app/streamlit_app.py`.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout all revisions: a Streamlit application interacting with a Snowflake database via an API to process natural language queries into SQL, execute the SQL, and display the results with interactive visualizations and filtering capabilities.

The changes across revisions are primarily incremental improvements and additions, rather than large-scale refactoring.  No significant structural changes to the code are observed.

Specifically, the changes include:

* **20/07/2025, 19:43:58 - 20/07/2025, 19:44:16:**  These early timestamps show essentially identical code, suggesting minor, inconsequential edits or perhaps simply multiple saves of the same version.

* **20/07/2025, 19:48:26 - 20/07/2025, 19:52:57:** No discernible changes in these revisions, again possibly just multiple saves.

* **20/07/2025, 20:04:54 - 20/07/2025, 20:05:58:** These revisions also appear to show no meaningful code changes.

* **20/07/2025, 20:11:15 - 20/07/2025, 20:18:17:**  These revisions show no code changes.

* **20/07/2025, 20:18:17:** This revision adds `'chat_input_value'` to the `initialize_session_state` function, suggesting the addition of a chat input field to the Streamlit app's user interface.

* **20/07/2025, 20:21:28 - 20/07/2025, 20:22:16:**  No notable changes.

* **20/07/2025, 20:24:32 - 20/07/2025, 20:28:32:**  A substantial change occurs in the `main` function. The addition of a section to handle `'chat_input_value'` demonstrates the implementation of handling user input for queries.  This section moves the input value to a `processed_input_value` state and then triggers a `st.rerun`. This indicates improved handling of user input, likely to improve the app's responsiveness and data flow.

* **20/07/2025, 20:28:32 - 20/07/2025, 20:35:22:**  The code within the `if 'pending_query' in st.session_state:` block in the `main` function is significantly modified.  This block now processes a pending query, appends it to the chat history, and prepares messages for the API, including the full chat history for context in multi-turn conversations. This represents a critical enhancement to the conversational aspect of the application, enabling multi-turn interactions with the natural language processing system.  The `api_messages` list now includes a dictionary with a 'type' and 'text' key, showing further refinement in API request formatting.


In summary, the codebase underwent incremental development focused primarily on enhancing the user interface with a chat input field and significantly improving the handling of user input for queries. The most important changes involve handling multi-turn conversations and refining the API request formatting, suggesting an iterative development approach to improve the application's natural language interface.


## 21:41:01
The log shows two entries for the file `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/cortex_streamlit_app/semantic_models/PAYMENTS_CONVERSION_ANALYSIS.yaml`, both at 20/07/2025 but with a slight time difference (21:38:31 and 21:39:02).  The file content is identical in both entries.  The file defines a semantic view named `PAYMENTS_CONVERSION_ANALYSIS` which is designed to analyze payment initiation and success rates at various levels (city, category, country).

The semantic view connects to several tables (`LINEITEM_DP` and `ONLINEPAYMENTTRANSACTIONS_DP`) residing in the `UC_DATA_PROD` database and `PUBLIC` schema.  Both tables contain multiple dimensions, including device OS, category, city, address, and various payment-related details such as payment entries, charges, discounts, and transaction IDs.  The `LINEITEM_DP` table includes timestamps for creation and last update. The `ONLINEPAYMENTTRANSACTIONS_DP` table's dimensions provide detailed information on each online payment transaction including app version, currency, failure reason, if it's a penny test, if the instrument was saved, operating system type, payment gateway used and the payment gateway's transaction ID.  There are no substantive changes between the two log entries.
