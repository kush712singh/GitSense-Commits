# Activity Summary for 20/07/2025

## 00:50:36
The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/cortex_streamlit_app/streamlit_app.py` file.  The key changes revolve around improving the Streamlit application's user interface and functionality.

The initial commit (20/07/2025, 00:09:22) establishes a Streamlit application named "Cortex Analyst - Natural Language to SQL," connecting to a Snowflake database via an API.  The application includes functions for sending natural language queries to the API, executing SQL queries received from the API, displaying results as DataFrames, and creating interactive visualizations using Plotly.

Subsequent commits (20/07/2025, 00:42:24, 00:42:45, 00:43:16, 00:43:38) rename the application to "Urban Company Text to SQL" and refine the application's UI/UX.  The API error messages are updated to reflect the new application name.  The most significant changes include:

* **00:42:45:** Addition of dynamic y-axis range adjustments in visualizations to improve readability.  The y-axis range now adapts to the data's minimum and maximum values with padding.
* **00:43:16:**  Removal of explicit sorting buttons.  The application now allows sorting by clicking directly on DataFrame column headers.
* **00:43:38:** The display of row count and a sorting tip is improved for better user experience.


Throughout the commits, the core functionality (Snowflake connection, API interaction, data processing, and visualization) remains consistent.  The changes primarily focus on enhancing the clarity and usability of the application.  The `SEMANTIC_MODELS` dictionary remains unchanged, indicating that the available data sources ("payments" and "finance") are not altered.

The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/cortex_streamlit_app/streamlit_app.py`.  The file is a Streamlit application that interacts with a Snowflake database via an API to provide a text-to-SQL interface.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout the revisions, but several changes are evident:

* **Initial Commit (01:00:25):** The initial commit establishes the basic structure of the application.  This includes importing necessary libraries (Streamlit, Pandas, Plotly, Snowflake connector), defining API endpoints and timeouts, and creating functions for:
    * Retrieving a Snowflake session.
    * Sending requests to the Urban Company Text-to-SQL API (`get_analyst_response`).
    * Executing SQL queries (`execute_sql_query`).
    * Filtering and displaying DataFrames (`filter_dataframe`, `display_dataframe_with_controls`).
    * Creating interactive visualizations (`create_visualizations`).
    * Managing Streamlit session state (`initialize_session_state`).
    * The main application logic (`main`).
    The application supports two "agents" ("payments" and "finance"), each linked to a different Snowflake semantic view.

* **Minor Revisions (01:00:38, 01:02:34, 01:04:07):** These commits show no substantive code changes; they appear to be incremental saves without functional alterations.

* **Typo Correction (01:09:57):**  A minor typo in `y__padding` was corrected to `y_padding` within the `create_visualizations` function.

* **Sidebar Enhancement (01:10:14, 01:10:33):** The application's sidebar was improved.  The agent selection was enhanced to automatically update the session state and trigger a page refresh (`st.rerun`) when the user changes the selected agent.  Additional information about the selected agent and its associated semantic view was also added.

* **Agent Description Added (01:20:44, 01:34:57):**  The final commit adds agent-specific descriptions to the sidebar.  For the "payments" agent, a description detailing the analysis focus (payment conversion, success rates, etc.) was introduced.  The "finance" agent description is incomplete ("placeholder").  These changes improve the user experience by providing context-specific information.

Throughout the entire process, the core functions and structure of the application remained largely unchanged.  The changes primarily focused on improving the user interface and user experience, adding descriptive information, and fixing a minor coding error.  The consistent use of `st.cache_resource` for the Snowflake session suggests a focus on efficiency and avoiding repeated database connections.
