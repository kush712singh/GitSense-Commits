# Activity Summary for 20/07/2025

## 00:50:36
The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/cortex_streamlit_app/streamlit_app.py` file.  The key changes revolve around improving the Streamlit application's user interface and functionality.

The initial commit (20/07/2025, 00:09:22) establishes a Streamlit application named "Cortex Analyst - Natural Language to SQL," connecting to a Snowflake database via an API.  The application includes functions for sending natural language queries to the API, executing SQL queries received from the API, displaying results as DataFrames, and creating interactive visualizations using Plotly.

Subsequent commits (20/07/2025, 00:42:24, 00:42:45, 00:43:16, 00:43:38) rename the application to "Urban Company Text to SQL" and refine the application's UI/UX.  The API error messages are updated to reflect the new application name.  The most significant changes include:

* **00:42:45:** Addition of dynamic y-axis range adjustments in visualizations to improve readability.  The y-axis range now adapts to the data's minimum and maximum values with padding.
* **00:43:16:**  Removal of explicit sorting buttons.  The application now allows sorting by clicking directly on DataFrame column headers.
* **00:43:38:** The display of row count and a sorting tip is improved for better user experience.


Throughout the commits, the core functionality (Snowflake connection, API interaction, data processing, and visualization) remains consistent.  The changes primarily focus on enhancing the clarity and usability of the application.  The `SEMANTIC_MODELS` dictionary remains unchanged, indicating that the available data sources ("payments" and "finance") are not altered.


## 09:30:33
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/cortex_streamlit_app/streamlit_app.py`.  The file is a Streamlit application that interacts with a Snowflake database via an API to provide a text-to-SQL interface.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout the revisions, but several changes are evident:

* **Initial Commit (01:00:25):** The initial commit establishes the basic structure of the application.  This includes importing necessary libraries (Streamlit, Pandas, Plotly, Snowflake connector), defining API endpoints and timeouts, and creating functions for:
    * Retrieving a Snowflake session.
    * Sending requests to the Urban Company Text-to-SQL API (`get_analyst_response`).
    * Executing SQL queries (`execute_sql_query`).
    * Filtering and displaying DataFrames (`filter_dataframe`, `display_dataframe_with_controls`).
    * Creating interactive visualizations (`create_visualizations`).
    * Managing Streamlit session state (`initialize_session_state`).
    * The main application logic (`main`).
    The application supports two "agents" ("payments" and "finance"), each linked to a different Snowflake semantic view.

* **Minor Revisions (01:00:38, 01:02:34, 01:04:07):** These commits show no substantive code changes; they appear to be incremental saves without functional alterations.

* **Typo Correction (01:09:57):**  A minor typo in `y__padding` was corrected to `y_padding` within the `create_visualizations` function.

* **Sidebar Enhancement (01:10:14, 01:10:33):** The application's sidebar was improved.  The agent selection was enhanced to automatically update the session state and trigger a page refresh (`st.rerun`) when the user changes the selected agent.  Additional information about the selected agent and its associated semantic view was also added.

* **Agent Description Added (01:20:44, 01:34:57):**  The final commit adds agent-specific descriptions to the sidebar.  For the "payments" agent, a description detailing the analysis focus (payment conversion, success rates, etc.) was introduced.  The "finance" agent description is incomplete ("placeholder").  These changes improve the user experience by providing context-specific information.

Throughout the entire process, the core functions and structure of the application remained largely unchanged.  The changes primarily focused on improving the user interface and user experience, adding descriptive information, and fixing a minor coding error.  The consistent use of `st.cache_resource` for the Snowflake session suggests a focus on efficiency and avoiding repeated database connections.


## 14:57:39
The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/cortex_streamlit_app/streamlit_app.py` file and the `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/cortex_streamlit_app/semantic_models/PAYMENTS_CONVERSION_ANALYSIS.yaml` file.  The `streamlit_app.py` file remained largely unchanged throughout the updates, indicating minor adjustments or no changes to the application logic itself between 09:33:07 and 09:45:33.


The  `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/cortex_streamlit_app/semantic_models/PAYMENTS_CONVERSION_ANALYSIS.yaml` file, however, underwent significant changes between 09:54:42 and 14:48:32. These changes primarily focused on enhancing the  `custom_instructions` section.


Specifically, the modifications introduced:


* **Standardized Time Periods:**  The YAML file now includes explicit definitions for handling various time period inputs ("Past 3 months," "Past 90 days," etc.), standardizing them to consistent date calculations using `DATEADD` function in Snowflake.  A default of 90 days was added for queries without a specified time range.

* **Standardized Aggregation Windows:** Similar to time periods, defaults for aggregation windows (daily, weekly, monthly) were introduced. The default aggregation was set to daily, unless otherwise specified in the query.

* **Country to Currency Mapping:** A new section was added to map country names (India, Singapore, UAE, Saudi Arabia) to their respective currency codes for simplified filtering.

The updates to the `custom_instructions` aim to create more consistent and predictable query results by imposing strict rules on how time periods, aggregation, and filtering are handled within the semantic model.  The overall goal appears to improve the user experience by simplifying query generation and making the results more reliable.
