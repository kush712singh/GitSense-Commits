The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/cortex_streamlit_app/streamlit_app.py` file.  The key changes revolve around improving the Streamlit application's user interface and functionality.

The initial commit (20/07/2025, 00:09:22) establishes a Streamlit application named "Cortex Analyst - Natural Language to SQL," connecting to a Snowflake database via an API.  The application includes functions for sending natural language queries to the API, executing SQL queries received from the API, displaying results as DataFrames, and creating interactive visualizations using Plotly.

Subsequent commits (20/07/2025, 00:42:24, 00:42:45, 00:43:16, 00:43:38) rename the application to "Urban Company Text to SQL" and refine the application's UI/UX.  The API error messages are updated to reflect the new application name.  The most significant changes include:

* **00:42:45:** Addition of dynamic y-axis range adjustments in visualizations to improve readability.  The y-axis range now adapts to the data's minimum and maximum values with padding.
* **00:43:16:**  Removal of explicit sorting buttons.  The application now allows sorting by clicking directly on DataFrame column headers.
* **00:43:38:** The display of row count and a sorting tip is improved for better user experience.


Throughout the commits, the core functionality (Snowflake connection, API interaction, data processing, and visualization) remains consistent.  The changes primarily focus on enhancing the clarity and usability of the application.  The `SEMANTIC_MODELS` dictionary remains unchanged, indicating that the available data sources ("payments" and "finance") are not altered.
