The log shows a single update to `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/resume_screener/prompts/initial_context.md` on 04/05/2025 at 14:55:47.  This file contains detailed instructions for screening engineering candidates for an SDE2 role at Urban Company.  The instructions specify the data structure of the input (a Google Sheet with candidate information), define screening criteria based on basic requirements (resume feedback, CTC, experience), career progression (role transitions and titles), and educational/professional background (Tier 1 institutions or work at specific companies).  The desired output format is also detailed, requiring candidate name, college, and reason for shortlisting.  The notes clarify aspects of experience evaluation, role transition significance, and CTC consideration.

The code changes reflect development on a lead pricing service.  The modifications span several files related to lead pricing details, calculations, and configurations.

On **04/05/2025, 16:26:32**, `/Users/kushalsingh/git/lead-pricing-service/src/service/lead-pricing-details/index.ts` was updated. This file contains functions for retrieving, saving, and updating lead pricing details using a `LeadPricingDetailsDm` data access layer.  The functions handle requests, validate request IDs, and interact with the database.

Seven minutes later, at **04/05/2025, 16:26:47**, `/Users/kushalsingh/git/lead-pricing-service/src/service/lead-pricing-details/dm/leadPricingDetails.ts` was modified. This file defines the Sequelize model (`LeadPricingDetails`) for storing lead pricing details in the database.  It includes fields such as `customer_request_id`, `pre_request_id`, various pricing-related parameters, and timestamps.  There's a note indicating a potential type mismatch for the `key_id` field.

A significant update occurred on **04/05/2025, 17:18:59** to `/Users/kushalsingh/git/lead-pricing-service/src/service/lead-price-calculator/index.ts`. This file implements the core lead price calculation logic. It uses various external services (`XpServiceClient`, `OrderEcosystemServiceClient`, etc.) and internal controllers (`LeadPricingConfigController`, `LeadPriceDetailsController`) to gather data and perform calculations. It includes two versions of the `calculateIncrementalLeadPrice` function (V1 and V2), suggesting iterative improvements.  The calculation involves determining pricing based on various parameters (city, customer category, packages) and applying different pricing models (BLP, DLP, GLP). The code extensively utilizes `lodash` for data manipulation and error handling.  Logging is implemented using `Singleton.Logger`.


The `/Users/kushalsingh/git/lead-pricing-service/src/service/lead-pricing-config/dm/index.ts` file was updated at **04/05/2025, 17:26:42**. This file manages the data layer for lead pricing configurations.  It includes functions for retrieving, creating, updating, and deactivating lead pricing configurations and their details and schedules. The functions heavily utilize `lodash` for data manipulation and filtering, and `moment` for date/time handling.  It also integrates with an audit logging system (`@uc-engg/audit-log`).  The code handles active/inactive status for configurations and schedules and includes logic to filter configurations based on various criteria (city, category, experiment ID, booking time).

Finally,  `/Users/kushalsingh/git/lead-pricing-service/src/service/lead-pricing-config/index.ts` was updated at **04/05/2025, 17:30:50**. This file provides an API layer for managing lead pricing configurations. It offers functions for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving configurations, including approval workflows through `AccessControlService`.  It leverages the data access layer (`LeadPricingConfigDm`) and includes helper functions for data transformation and manipulation.  The file also incorporates functions to handle config details, schedules, and incorporates error handling and logging.  A `comparer` function is defined to efficiently identify differences between arrays of config details for updates.  Functions for fetching config details based on booking times are added to handle multiple scenarios (city/category or experiment IDs).
