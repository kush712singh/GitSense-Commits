# Activity Summary for 03/05/2025

## 00:37:32
The log shows the development of two Python scripts: `resume_parser.py` and `resume_shortlister.py`,  along with a CSV file (`Test-sheet - Sheet1.csv`) containing candidate data.

`/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/Test-sheet - Sheet1.csv`  contains candidate information including name, college, graduation year, current company, experience, CTC, joining time, CV URL, LinkedIn URL, current location, and resume feedback. This file remains unchanged throughout the log.

`resume_parser.py` undergoes multiple revisions between 23:49:32 and 00:31:41 on 03/05/2025.  The core functionality involves downloading resumes from Google Drive URLs provided in the CSV, extracting text using PyPDF2, and using the Ollama API (specified by `OLLAMA_URL` and `OLLAMA_MODEL`) to analyze the text for role transitions within the same company and to extract relevant roles.  Significant changes include:

* **02/05/2025, 23:49:32 & 23:49:42:** Initial versions of `resume_parser.py` are nearly identical, focusing on downloading PDFs from Google Drive links, extracting text, and using Ollama to check for role transitions.
* **03/05/2025, 00:06:48 - 00:31:41:**  Subsequent commits expand the script's capabilities.  The script now incorporates lists of `TIER1_COLLEGES` and `GOOD_COMPANIES`, and new functions are added: `ollama_query` (simplifies Ollama API calls), `extract_roles_with_ollama` (extracts roles and companies from resumes), `is_tier1_college`, `get_matching_good_companies`, `has_sde2_or_senior_role`,  improved `ctc_in_range` and `exp_in_range` functions for better handling of various input formats, and updated logic to incorporate stricter filtering criteria based on these additions.  The main script now iterates through a dataframe, applies multiple filters, and only saves candidates who meet all the conditions.  There's a noticeable improvement in error handling and logging throughout the process.  The final version uses regular expressions (`re`) to improve the `ctc_in_range` function's robustness.


`resume_shortlister.py` is created at 03/05/2025, 00:05:27 and remains unchanged afterwards. It uses OpenAI's API (`openai.api_key`) to filter resumes based on factors like experience, college tier, company reputation, and role transitions, employing functions like  `extract_text_from_pdf`, `check_role_transition`, `check_sde2_title`, `check_tier1_college`, and `check_good_company`, before making a final judgment using an LLM (GPT-4) for borderline cases.  The script uses predefined lists of `TIER1_TAGS` and `GOOD_COMPANIES`.


The overall development pattern shows an iterative process, starting with basic resume parsing and progressing towards a more sophisticated resume shortlisting system with increased functionality and robustness.  The use of external APIs (Ollama and OpenAI) highlights a reliance on external services for complex tasks like natural language processing.  The repeated modifications to `resume_parser.py` reflect a continuous refinement of the resume parsing and analysis logic.
