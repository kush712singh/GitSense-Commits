The log shows a single file, `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/xl_chatbot_app/main_app.py`, updated on 20/08/2025 at 13:06:10.  This Python file appears to be the main application file for an XL Chatbot.  The code defines several functions related to data loading, processing, and analysis.

Key functions include:

* **`initialize_session_state()`**: Initializes Streamlit session state variables for data handling and chatbot interaction.
* **`create_duckdb_connection()`**: Creates a connection to an in-memory DuckDB database.
* **`clean_table_name()`**: Cleans a file name to create a valid SQL table name.
* **`load_file_to_dataframe()`**: Loads data from CSV or Excel files into a Pandas DataFrame.
* **`load_dataframe_to_duckdb()`**: Loads a Pandas DataFrame into the DuckDB database, handling potential errors gracefully.
* **`classify_column_heuristic()`**: This is a crucial function that classifies columns into five categories: `TIME_DIMENSION`, `METRIC`, `DIMENSION`, `FACT`, and `LONG_TEXT`. It uses a sophisticated heuristic approach based on column names, data types, cardinality, and value patterns (including regular expressions for date/time detection and Unix timestamps).
* **`create_basic_semantic_model()`**: Creates a semantic model of the data based on the column classifications from `classify_column_heuristic()`, organizing columns into different categories for easier analysis and querying.

The code uses several libraries, including `streamlit`, `pandas`, `duckdb`, `yaml`, `plotly`, and potentially others (due to the `ImportError` handling).  The code suggests the application allows users to upload data, which is then analyzed and used for interactions within a chatbot interface. The sophisticated column classification function is a highlight, indicating advanced data understanding capabilities beyond simple data type identification.
