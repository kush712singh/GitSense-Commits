# Activity Summary for 30/08/2025

## 09:53:32
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/xl_chatbot_app/main_app.py` file and one file `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/xl_chatbot_app/test_main_app.py`.  The `main_app.py` file underwent several minor edits between 21:53:02 and 22:45:13 on August 29th, 2025, with no substantial code changes.  The final version includes functions for initializing session states, creating DuckDB connections, cleaning table names, loading files into Pandas DataFrames, loading data into DuckDB, classifying columns heuristically (with a 5-type system: DIMENSION, TIME_DIMENSION, METRIC, FACT, LONG_TEXT), and creating a basic semantic model. The heuristic column classification is quite extensive, incorporating checks on column names, data types, and sample values to improve accuracy.

A significant change occurred between 22:01:13 and 22:01:30, where the `re` module was added to the imports, indicating that regular expressions were incorporated, probably within the `classify_column_heuristic` function. Another minor change happened between 22:37:21 and 22:45:13, and the changes did not add or remove significant code.


The `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/xl_chatbot_app/test_main_app.py` file was also updated  between 22:41:59 and 22:45:13 on August 29th, 2025. The unit tests cover SQL query parsing (including handling joins and CTEs), data visualization (partially mocked due to Streamlit dependencies), and multiple query executions.  The test suite was improved by focusing on testable aspects, such as data preparation and aggregation logic, while using mocking to handle the Streamlit UI interactions.  The changes made during this period demonstrate a shift towards more comprehensive testing and better handling of edge cases.

The `config/prompt_constants.py` file, modified at 22:51:38 and 09:51:29 on August 29th and 30th respectively, contains prompts for an AI engine, using a TCREI (Typed Customer Request Evaluation Interface) format.  The prompts are designed to classify columns into semantic types (dimension, metric, fact, time_dimension, high_cardinality_dimension, metric_candidate, long_text) and to translate natural language questions into SQL. There are two versions of the column classification prompt: a backup version with a simpler 4-type system and a newer, more sophisticated version with a 5-type system  The differences between the two versions primarily relate to the number of semantic types supported and the increased detail and specificity in the instructions for the AI model.
