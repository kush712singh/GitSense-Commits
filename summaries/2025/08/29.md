# Activity Summary for 29/08/2025

## 00:56:42
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/xl_chatbot_app/config/prompt_constants.py` between 00:28:15 and 00:45:35 on August 29, 2025.  These updates primarily involve refining the `COLUMN_CLASSIFICATION` prompt.  Initially, this prompt used a four-type classification system (dimension, metric, fact, time_dimension).  Later versions revised this to a five-type system, adding `high_cardinality_dimension` and `long_text` categories.  The instructions within the `COLUMN_CLASSIFICATION` prompt were significantly altered to reflect this change, providing more detailed rules and explanations for each column type. The `COLUMN_CLASSIFICATION_BACKUP` remains unchanged, preserving the original four-type system.  The `TEXT_TO_SQL` prompt remained consistent throughout the log.

A separate file, `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/xl_chatbot_app/main_app.py`, was updated at 00:41:34 on the same day. This file contains Python code for a data analysis application using Streamlit, pandas, DuckDB, and OpenAI's GPT models. The update includes a new function, `classify_column_heuristic`, which implements a more advanced heuristic-based column classification, aligning with the five-type system introduced in `prompt_constants.py`.  This function incorporates more sophisticated pattern matching for date/time columns and improved handling of numeric and text columns.  The `create_basic_semantic_model` function also shows adaptation for the 5-category system.
