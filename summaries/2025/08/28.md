# Activity Summary for 28/08/2025

## 23:56:43
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/xl_chatbot_app/config/prompt_constants.py` file between 23:09:31 and 23:11:27,  primarily modifying the `COLUMN_CLASSIFICATION` prompt.  The changes refine the instructions for classifying columns within a dataset, adding a distinction between `fact_table` and `dimension_table` and introducing new column types (`high_cardinality_dimension`, `metric_candidate`, `long_text`). The `COLUMN_CLASSIFICATION_BACKUP` remains unchanged, preserving an earlier version of the column classification prompt.  The `TEXT_TO_SQL` prompt also appears, but it is incomplete in the provided log snippets.

The `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/xl_chatbot_app/sample_data/cursor_report/queries.txt` file contains a single entry at 23:07:15, specifying SQL queries to determine the total weekly user requests and the most frequently used models.

Finally, the `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/xl_chatbot_app/components/ai_engine.py` file was updated at 23:11:42. This update focuses on improving the `should_exclude_column_from_ai` function, now using character length as the primary metric for detecting long text columns, instead of word count.  Other changes include improvements to functions for filtering columns (`filter_columns_for_ai_analysis`), preparing column information for AI analysis (`prepare_column_info_for_ai`), and truncating sample values (`truncate_sample_values`).  The `get_query_instructions` function provides specific instructions for SQL query generation, including rules for column value matching, case-insensitive matching, and time period standardization.

The `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/xl_chatbot_app/modules/semantic_builder.py` file, updated at 23:11:52, introduces classes for local semantic building (`LocalSemanticBuilder`), dynamic prompt data filtering (`DynamicPromptDataFilter`), and dynamic prompt generation (`DynamicPromptGenerator`).  The classes work together to handle local classification of long text columns and prepare data for LLM-based column classification and text-to-SQL tasks. The `LLMPromptBuilder` class generates complete prompts, incorporating dynamic data generated by `DynamicPromptGenerator`, for both column classification and text-to-SQL tasks.  The code uses a "TCREI" format for prompts, which suggests a structured approach to prompting the AI models.
