The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/xl_chatbot_app/config/prompt_constants.py` file between 23:43:23 and 23:45:15 on August 18, 2025.  The file contains various AI prompts in a format called TCREI (Typed Customer Request Evaluation Interface).  The key changes center around the `COLUMN_CLASSIFICATION` prompt.

Initially, a backup version (`COLUMN_CLASSIFICATION_BACKUP`) existed, defining a column classification task with four semantic types (dimension, metric, fact, time_dimension).  Later revisions modified  `COLUMN_CLASSIFICATION` to include a refined classification with five semantic types:  adding  'high_cardinality_dimension' and 'long_text', and also introducing a 'table_type' classification ('fact_table' or 'dimension_table').  The instructions and classification rules were significantly expanded to reflect this more granular approach.  The `maxTokens` parameter in the `modelConfig` for `COLUMN_CLASSIFICATION` was reduced from 3000 to 2500.  The `COLUMN_CLASSIFICATION_BACKUP` remained unchanged throughout the revisions.  A `TEXT_TO_SQL` prompt is also present, but it didn't change during the logged period.  The overall pattern is iterative refinement of the column classification prompt for improved accuracy and detail.
