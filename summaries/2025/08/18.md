# Activity Summary for 18/08/2025

## 01:25:15
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/xl_chatbot_app/config/prompt_constants.py` between 00:40:17 and 00:44:58 on August 18, 2025.  These revisions primarily involve modifications to the `COLUMN_CLASSIFICATION` prompt.  The initial version (00:40:17) defines four column types (`dimension`, `metric`, `fact`, `time_dimension`). A subsequent revision (00:40:50) expands this to five types, adding `high_cardinality_dimension` and `long_text`, and refines the instructions for classifying columns and the expected JSON output structure.  The subsequent changes to `prompt_constants.py` (00:42:36, 00:43:12, 00:44:18, 00:44:28, 00:44:58)  appear to be redundant, showing no actual code changes from the 00:40:50 version.

The file `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/xl_chatbot_app/modules/semantic_builder.py` undergoes several modifications between 00:51:49 and 00:55:43 on the same day. These changes introduce and refine a module focused on semantic building, leveraging both local heuristic rules and Large Language Models (LLMs).  The `LocalSemanticBuilder` class is implemented to locally identify "long text" columns based on criteria such as average character length, word count, and special character density. The `DynamicPromptDataFilter` class filters column data for LLM processing, excluding locally classified columns and optimizing sample values based on cardinality. The `DynamicPromptGenerator` class generates dynamic data for column classification and text-to-SQL prompts, incorporating rich metadata like data types, sample values, and descriptions. A notable addition is the attempt to integrate context hints generated by a `enhance_context_with_patterns` function from `main_app.py` into the text-to-SQL data generation (00:55:33, 00:55:43).  The overall pattern suggests iterative development and refinement of the semantic analysis pipeline.

The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/xl_chatbot_app/modules/semantic_builder.py` between 11:33:36 and 12:01:19 on August 18, 2025.  These updates appear to be minor edits or refinements, as the code remains largely unchanged across these revisions.  No substantive changes to the functionality of the `semantic_builder.py` file are evident.

The file `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/xl_chatbot_app/config/prompt_constants.py` was updated four times between 12:31:00 and 12:32:32 on August 18, 2025. These changes focus on the `COLUMN_CLASSIFICATION` and `COLUMN_CLASSIFICATION_BACKUP` prompt definitions within the `PromptConstants` class.  The primary difference seems to be a significant revision to the `instructions` section of the `COLUMN_CLASSIFICATION` prompt, expanding the classification categories from four ("dimension", "metric", "fact", "time_dimension") to five, adding "high_cardinality_dimension" and refining the classification rules and expected output format (JSON array to JSON object).  The `COLUMN_CLASSIFICATION_BACKUP` appears to be a preserved older version of the prompt.  The `TEXT_TO_SQL` prompt definition remains truncated in the provided log excerpts.
