The log shows modifications to `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/xl_chatbot_app/config/prompt_constants.py` on 17/08/2025 at 21:10:44.  The file contains Python code defining constants for AI prompts, specifically focusing on a "Typed Customer Request Evaluation Interface" (TCREI) format.  The key updates are the definition of two main prompt constants: `COLUMN_CLASSIFICATION` and `TEXT_TO_SQL`.  A backup version of the `TEXT_TO_SQL` prompt, `TEXT_TO_SQL_BACKUP`, is also included.

`COLUMN_CLASSIFICATION` details a prompt for classifying dataset columns into semantic types (dimension, metric, fact, time_dimension), providing detailed instructions on the classification process and specifying the expected JSON output schema.  The prompt includes instructions for handling high cardinality fields, numeric fields, dates, and cases of uncertainty.

`TEXT_TO_SQL` and `TEXT_TO_SQL_BACKUP` both define prompts for converting natural language questions into SQL queries using a provided semantic model.  However, they differ in their instructions and business rules. `TEXT_TO_SQL` emphasizes case-insensitive filtering (ILIKE), handling of long text columns, specific date formatting, and division by zero prevention.  `TEXT_TO_SQL_BACKUP` focuses on simpler instructions, using exact column names from the semantic model, and exact string matching for dimensions with sample values. Both versions specify the desired JSON output schema containing the SQL query and an explanation.

Both `TEXT_TO_SQL` and `TEXT_TO_SQL_BACKUP` utilize the `gpt-4o` OpenAI model with similar parameters, indicating a preference for this model for both tasks.  The primary difference lies in the complexity and specificity of the instructions provided to the model for generating SQL queries.  The existence of a backup suggests an iterative refinement process in defining the prompt for optimal SQL query generation.
