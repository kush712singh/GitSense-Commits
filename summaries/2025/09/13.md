The log shows updates to `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/xl_chatbot_app/config/prompt_constants.py` on 13/09/2025 at 17:39:12.  The file contains Python code defining a `PromptConstants` class. This class stores AI prompts in a format called TCREI (Typed Customer Request Evaluation Interface).

The key change is the addition of two dictionaries: `COLUMN_CLASSIFICATION` and `HRMS_COLUMN_CLASSIFICATION`. Both dictionaries define prompts for classifying columns in a dataset,  but they target different domains.

`COLUMN_CLASSIFICATION` is a generic prompt for classifying columns into semantic types (dimension, time_dimension, high_cardinality_dimension, metric_candidate, long_text) with detailed instructions and examples.  It specifies a JSON output schema.

`HRMS_COLUMN_CLASSIFICATION` builds upon `COLUMN_CLASSIFICATION`, adapting the prompt specifically for Human Resource Management System (HRMS) datasets.  It reuses much of the core structure (table classification, column classification types, output requirements, and classification rules) from the generic prompt, adding an HR-specific context and examples.  This suggests a pattern of creating specialized prompts by extending a base generic prompt.  The significant change is the creation of a specialized prompt for HR data, leveraging the existing generic structure for efficiency and consistency.
