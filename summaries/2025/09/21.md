# Activity Summary for 21/09/2025

The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/xl_chatbot_app/config/prompt_constants.py` between 18:51:36 and 18:53:36 on September 21, 2025.  These revisions appear to be minor edits and likely do not represent substantial functional changes to the code itself. The code defines two dictionaries, `COLUMN_CLASSIFICATION` and `HRMS_COLUMN_CLASSIFICATION`,  containing prompts for an AI model to classify columns in a dataset.  `HRMS_COLUMN_CLASSIFICATION` appears to be based on `COLUMN_CLASSIFICATION`, inheriting much of its structure.  Both prompts are designed to classify columns into semantic types ("dimension", "time_dimension", "high_cardinality_dimension", "metric_candidate", "long_text") and provide detailed descriptions, aliases, and justifications.  The changes in the log primarily focus on minor phrasing adjustments within the instructions and requirements of the prompts.


The `/Users/kushalsingh/git/cursor/xl_chatbot_app/STARTUP_GUIDE.md` file underwent several revisions between 18:53:43 and 18:55:34 on the same day.
